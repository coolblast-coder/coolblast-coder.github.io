           <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Anton Lyapunov. I am 25. </p>
            <p>I am from Kazakhstan, a country located in Eurasia between Russia and China. </p>

            <p>I have been in Canada for 8 years. And I fell in love with this country.</p>
            <p>Immediately after school, I entered the Electronical Engineering program and successfully completed it. After graduating from Seneca College, I continued to work for the company where I was doing an internship (COOP program). While continuing
                to work in the internship company, I realized that I had not enough knowledge in the field of computer technology. In the 21st century, this knowledge is needed and important everywhere. Therefore, I decided to continue my education and
                gain knowledge in the field of computer technology. I hope that the knowledge gained at the Faculty of Electronics, together with the knowledge that I will receive now will help me in my future professional life.</p>
